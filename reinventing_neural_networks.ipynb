    "Okay, so this is clearly not working. At this point, we're not using converting into classes based on the output value, but still, I'd expect the output values to be higher at (0, 1) and (1, 0). But instead, it seems like they pretty much correspond to the input values (1, 1) is almost always the highest, (0, 0) is always 0, and (0, 1) and (1, 0) are almost always about half of (1, 1). Interestingly, the 4 classes summed together is very near 1 - which is kind of surprising considering I'm not explicitly doing any probability normalizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "So why is this not working? My guess is that, since the \"expected value\" used to calculate the error with is always either 0 or 1, it's being almost entirely factored out by large network output values. So to fix this, we'd probably want the network values to be something in the 0 to 1 range (to match the classes).\n",

    "In the previous attempt, the output power of a neuron was proportional to the magnitude of it's input. But from doing a bit of research on [Neural action potentials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential), it seems like the output of a neuron should not be proportinal to the input:\n",

    "> \"The amplitude of an action potential is independent of the amount of current that produced it. In other words, larger currents do not create larger action potentials.
